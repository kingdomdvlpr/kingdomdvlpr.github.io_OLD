##...with the website developers community, in general.

The worst feeling in the world is to search for help with your website and find out that help is at every turn but pricing is out of control.  I'm not even sure about customer service.  Everybody is trying to get into the "coding" business and I feel people that really need help are suffering or will just start a Wix site and forget about it.

With my rant over...I would like to offer my assistance.  I won't bore you with technical stuff nor hit you with a crazy pricing scheme.  I don't think websites or maintenance for a site should be expensive and I plan to pass that idea on to customers.
